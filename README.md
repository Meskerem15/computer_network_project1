1. Overview

This project involved creating and hosting a website to demonstrate networking principles like DNS, IP addressing, and HTTPS. 
The site was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages.

2. Setup Process

Hosting & Domain: Used GitHub Pageswith free HTTPS.
Website Development: Designed a basic webpage with styling and a script to fetch the user’s public IP.
Security Measures: Enabled HTTPS, set up a firewall (Cloudflare WAF), and restricted access using .htaccess.

3. Challenges & Solutions

DNS Delay: The domain took time to resolve globally.
CORS Issues: Resolved using a CORS-compliant API for fetching IPs.
HTTPS Setup: Enforced HTTPS to secure data transfer.

4. Networking Concepts Applied

DNS & IP Addressing: Mapped a domain to a server’s public IP.
HTTP/HTTPS: Used SSL encryption for secure data transfer.
Security Features: Implemented firewall, HTTPS, and access controls to prevent threats.

5. Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated website hosting, networking principles, and security best practices. 
Future improvements include CDN optimization and user authentication.
